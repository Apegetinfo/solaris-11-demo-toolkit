S In this demo we will demonstrate how you can save disk space 
S by using ZFS compression feature.
S
S We will move system manuals to a compressed ZFS file system and
S compare the disk usage.
S First, we create a new file system and turn compression on.
C zfs create rpool/zman
C zfs set compression=gzip rpool/zman 
S Then we copy our system manuals to this directory. To save time, 
S we copy only the first section of the manuals.
C cp -rp /usr/share/man/man1 /rpool/zman/
S Now compare the sizes:
C du -sh /usr/share/man/man1 /rpool/zman/man1
S We just saved about 60% of disk space. Not bad!
S Check is you still can use this directory to read manuals:
C bash -c "export MANPATH=/rpool/zman; man ls" 
S It works!
S  
S This concludes ZFS Compression demo. 
S Cleaning up...
system("zfs destroy rpool/zman");
