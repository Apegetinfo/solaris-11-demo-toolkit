S In this demo we will create and use ZFS snapshots and clones.
S  
S First of all, list ZFS snapshots that already exist in the system:
C zfs list -t snapshot
S Even when in a freshly installed system there is at least one
S snapshot, it's called @install
S Imagine you have created a file called myfile.txt in your home directory...
C cd ~
chdir("/export/home/lab");
C echo 'Once upon a time...' > myfile.txt
S Check if it exists and contains our words:
C cat myfile.txt
S Now let's create a snapshot of our file system.
S First, we have to find out which filesystem we are on.
C zfs list \$PWD
S Now create a snapshot:
C zfs snapshot rpool/export/home/lab@snap1
S Imagine we have accidentally deleted our file:
C rm myfile.txt
S It's not there anymore!
C cat myfile.txt
S What can we do? Simply rollback your snapshot and your file is back!
C zfs rollback rpool/export/home/lab@snap1
S Check your file again:
C cat myfile.txt
S Your file is there!
S   
S It's simple, it's fast, it doesn't require extra space until your start
S making changes.
S   
S Couple of best practice tips:
S 
S - Use a naming scheme to name your snapshots. The simplest scheme is to use 
S the output of date command to timestamp your snapshots. Also you can give
S your snapshots meaningful names like @before-update
S  
S - It is also possible to delegate certain rights to normal users. For
S example, you can delegate the rights to snapshot and rollback their home
S directories.
S   
S - You can automate snapshots by enabling the zfs/auto-snapshot service.
S   
S Now we are going to create a clone of the ZFS file system. Clones are
S similar to snapshots, but they can be modified independently from the
S parent file system.
C zfs clone rpool/export/home/lab@snap1 rpool/export/home/lab2
S Now you can go to the cloned file system and modify files there. Files 
S in the original file system will remain intact.
C cd /export/home/lab2
chdir("/export/home/lab2");
C gzip myfile.txt
C rm -rf Desktop Documents Downloads
C ls
C cd /export/home/lab
chdir("/export/home/lab");
C ls
S Similarly to snapshots, clones take very little disk space until you start
S making changes.
C zfs list | grep home/lab
S This completes ZFS Snapshots and Clones demo session.
S Cleaning up...
system("zfs destroy rpool/export/home/lab2");
system("zfs destroy rpool/export/home/lab\@snap1");
system("rm ~lab/myfile.txt");
print RESET;
