S In this demo we will show how to create an activate Boot Environments
S 
S In Oracle Solaris 11 there is only one command to manage Boot Environments:
S            beadm(1M)
S
S Let's start with listing all available boot environments:
C beadm list
S You see the boot environment's name and if it's active. Letter N in the
S Active column means this BE is active Now, letter R means it will be active
S after reboot.
S Let's create a new boot environment, which will be cloned from the current
S one.
C beadm create new-be
C beadm list
S If we want to boot this BE at the next boot, we have to make it active.
C beadm activate new-be
C beadm list
S Do you see the difference? solaris BE is active Now, but new-be will be
S active on the next Reboot.
S But before rebooting let's imagine we want to install and/or update a
S couple of packages, but we want to have a backup plan in case something
S goes wrong.
S
S To do that, we can mount the new BE and install packages there using pkg(1)
S command.
C beadm mount new-be /mnt
C ls /mnt
C pkg -R /mnt install tomcat
S We have installed a Tomcat server in our new boot environment. Make sure
S that Tomcat is not installed in the current boot environment:
C svcs *tomcat*
S We can check that the sizes between the two boot environments have
S changed
C beadm list
