S This script demonstrates some of the key features of the Service S Management
S Facility (SMF). SMF is responsible for managing system and application services
S on Oracle Solaris 11.
S
S We can see a list of services that are enabled on a system
C svcs
S While the above command lists the services that are enabled (or temporarily
S disabled), we can get a list of all installed services using the -a option
C svcs -a
S Let's get a count of those services - first the enabled services, and then
S the installed services
C svcs | wc -l
C svcs -a | wc -l
S Now let's get some basic information about a particular service, in this case
S the service responsible for ensuring Oracle Solaris Zones are automatically
S started on system reboot
C svcs -l svc:/system/zones:default 
S We could have also got the same result by taking a shorter form
C svcs -l zones
S We can list what dependencies the zones service has
C svcs -d zones
S And also what services depend on the zone service
C svcs -D zones
S In the above we didn't see any results, but let's look at the
S svc:/systems/zones-monitoring:default service instance
C svcs -D zones-monitoring
S SMF uses services as a higher level object so that we never have to worry about
S individual processes. But we can also easily find out this information.
C svcs -p zones-monitoring
S And finally, to quickly get a list of malfunctioning services (due to errors),
S we can use the -xv option
C svcs -xv
