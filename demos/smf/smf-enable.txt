S This script demonstrates how to enable and disable services using the 
S Service Management Facility (SMF).
S
S Let's first take a look at all services that have been installed on the
S system - this list includes both enabled and disabled services.
C svcs -a
S Lets's take a look at the svc:/application/management/net-snmp:default
S service
C svcs -l net-snmp
S Let's enable this service (and enable any other services that are marked as
S service dependencies for net-snmp)
C svcadm enable net-snmp
S And we can check the service status again
C svcs -l net-snmp
S We can use the -p option to check what processes have been started due to
S this service being enabled
C svcs -p net-snmp
S And indeed the SNMP agent works as expected
C snmpwalk -v 1 -c public localhost
S One of the core features of SMF is the ability to restart services in the
S event there is a failure. Let's kill the snmpd daemon and see what happens
S to it
C pkill snmpd
S On a legacy system that's using the init start-up mechanism we may encounter
S a failure, but not with SMF. Let's check the status of our service
C svcs net-snmp
S And we can double check this by looking for the snmpd daemon in a process
S listing.
C ps -ef | grep snmpd
S We can easily disable this service if we do not need it again
C svcadm disable net-snmp
S And make sure the snmpd process is no longer running
C svcs net-snmp
C ps -ef | grep snmpd
