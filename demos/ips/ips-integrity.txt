S This script demonstrates how to perform intergity checks on packages.
C pkg contents -t file -o owner,group,mode,pkg.size,path sudo
S Show how we can verify a package has not been compromised
C pkg verify sudo
S Let's check the permission bits of sudo
C ls -l /usr/bin/sudo
S Let's say someone changed the permissions bits on us like this
C chmod 777 /usr/bin/sudo
S Let's verify again, and it will return an error
S pkg verify sudo
S Now let's fix this package
S pkg fix sudo
S Let's verify again to make sure it's all right now:
C pkg verify sudo
S The next few lines show an interesting way of getting a package name from
S a file name
S We first get a SHA1 digest of 'vi'
C digest -a sha1 /usr/bin/vi
S Since the digest is saved in the package DB, we can search for that hash
S and see what matches it
C pkg search -l 78ff0954c1f0381504356d08209c1fd3dfb2f9a1
