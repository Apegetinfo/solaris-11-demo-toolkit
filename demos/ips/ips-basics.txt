S This script demonstrates some of the key features of the Image Packaging
S System (IPS). IPS is a network based package management system, new to
S Oracle Solaris 11.
S
S IPS uses network package repositories to install softare from. These
S package repositories can be remote and served over http or https, or
S local to the system.
S
S So the first thing we do is show our currently configured repositories.
S A publisher is someone or a group who makes software available through
S package repositories.
S
C pkg publisher
S We can show some details about this publisher, like how many software
S packages it includes, and when it was last updated
C pkgrepo info -s http://pkg.oracle.com/solaris/release
S Let's now look at what packages have been installed on this system
C pkg list
S Let's also do a quick count of those packages
C pkg list | wc -l
S We can also list how many packages are available in the repository that
S can be installed
C pkg list -a | wc -l
S Let's take look at the gzip package and get some basic information about it.
S First of all, let's look at a summary of the package
C pkg info gzip
S Now that we've seen some basic information, let's try and find out some
S information about what the gzip package contains
C pkg contents gzip
S Lastly, we show how you can view a history of package commands
C pkg history
S And a verbose history
C pkg history -l|more
