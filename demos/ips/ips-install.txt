S This demo shows how to install and uninstall packages using the Image
S Packaging System on Oracle Solaris 11.
S
S Let's say we want to do some network load testing, so we want to run the
S utility called 'iperf'. The command will not be found because it's not
S currently installed
C iperf
S Let's take a guess that the package might be called 'iperf' and try and
S get some information about it
C pkg info iperf
S Let's use the -r option as is suggested
C pkg info -r iperf
S We can use IPS to search for iperf in the remote repository
C pkg search iperf
S We can also see what additional packages that iperf depends on
C pkg search benchmark/iperf:depend::
S We can also show what the contents of this package is
S pkg contents -r iperf
S So let's now go ahead and install this package
C pkg install iperf
S And run the iperf command again
C iperf
S We can easily check the contents of this package
C pkg contents iperf
S And finally, we can uninstall the package
C pkg uninstall iperf
